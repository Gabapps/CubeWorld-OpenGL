CubeWorld-OpenGL
================

This is a simple 3D scene I realised with OpenGL during my last year in highschool. That's my first try with the OpenGL library. That explains why the code isn't well organized.

Here is what actually works or not :
- Graphics :
  Works :
    - The engine can draw cubics meshes at some position.
- Physics :
  Works :
    - The weight strength is well handled.
    - The collision detection works on mostly all sides.
  Doesn't work 
    - The top-sides collision aren't working.
