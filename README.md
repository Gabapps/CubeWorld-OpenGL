CubeWorld-OpenGL
================

This is a simple game I released with OpenGL in the last year of highschool. Let's improve it !

For the moment, the code isn't well organized.

Here is what actually works or not :
- Graphics :
  Works :
    - The engine can draw cubics meshes at some position.
- Physics :
  Works :
    - The weight strength is well handled.
    - The collision detection works on mostly all sides.
  Doesn't work 
    - The top-sides collision aren't working.
    
I'll improve it by using my knowledge in Unity3D game engine.
